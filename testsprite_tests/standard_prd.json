  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on the homepage, sees a single animated VAYRA logo above the hero header, and can easily navigate to sign-in/signup pages.",
    "New or returning users authenticate via email/password or Google sign-in, triggering Firestore user doc creation with default free plan.",
    "Authenticated users are routed to a protected dashboard with access controlled by subscription plan; free users are redirected to the upgrade page.",
    "Users can view and select subscription plans and upgrade directly within the app, unlocking additional features.",

    "Authentication flows work without generic errors: email sign-up, sign-in, Google OAuth with proper Firestore user doc creation and friendly errors for edge cases.",
    "Unauthenticated users accessing the dashboard are redirected to sign-in; plan gating redirects free users to upgrade page properly.",
    "No console errors or network 4xx/5xx errors on main routes including landing, auth, dashboard, and upgrade pages.",
    "Axe-core accessibility scans on landing and auth pages return zero critical violations.",
    "Responsive layouts work on standard mobile (375x812) and desktop (1280x800) viewports without content overlap or clipping.",
    "Lighthouse scores for mobile on landing and dashboard maintain ≥90 across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.",
    "Service worker registers only in production; app correctly supports offline caching without breaking asset updates.",
    "Session persistence maintained across page reloads: user remains signed in after reload with no permission errors on Firestore reads/writes."
