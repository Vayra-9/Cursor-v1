## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: Hero Logo Branding & Motion
- **Description:** Hero logo presence, uniqueness, animations, and motion preferences.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC001
- **Test Name:** Landing Page Logo Presence and Uniqueness
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC001_Landing_Page_Logo_Presence_and_Uniqueness.py)
