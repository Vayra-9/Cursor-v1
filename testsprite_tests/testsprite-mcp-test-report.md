- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC014_Error_Boundary_Handling_on_Runtime_Exceptions.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that runtime JavaScript errors within components trigger error boundaries and show fallback UI without crashing the entire app was partially completed. Form validation errors were tested and handled gracefully without crashing the app, indicating some error handling is in place. However, a direct runtime JavaScript error inside a component to explicitly trigger error boundaries and fallback UI was not simulated due to lack of direct UI controls or test hooks.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/ddbbe4aa-4fb8-41af-847f-d179bef62be5/e0c51350-75b9-44af-ace8-ff2b81fda10f
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Analysis / Findings:** Test was partially completed. The app handled form validation errors gracefully without crash, but a direct runtime JS error triggering error boundary fallback UI was not simulated due to lack of UI controls or test hooks. Add dedicated test components or developer hooks to simulate runtime errors explicitly triggering error boundaries and fallback UI.
